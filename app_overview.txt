                            Application overview
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| This is a summary of the overarching structure and purpose of the application, along with
| the software versions supporting its operation. A complete list of stages is included for
| clarity.
| This application, named computational psychiatry, has two components — web-based
| forms and behavioural tasks. The web-based forms are primarily self-report psychiatric
| symptom inventories but also include demographic, functional (SDS), and general
| intelligence information (ICAR). The behavioural tasks gamify cross-species tests of volition.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please install Python 3.7.5 and Psiturk 2.3.8 for optimal performance of the application.

Instructions for how to have install Psiturk on your computer are provided below.

Prior to installing psiturk you need to have installed "pip".

Once pip is installed, type into a terminal:
----------------------------------
|    pip install psiturk         |
----------------------------------
If the command above doesn’t work, then try:
----------------------------------
|    sudo pip install psiturk    |
----------------------------------

If the install was successful then you will have a new command psiturk available on your command line.
You can check the location of this command by typing:
----------------------------------
|          which psiturk         |
----------------------------------

Further information is available at https://psiturk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install

Then, clone the folder pittask from the following Github repo https://github.com/Serge-/pittask.html

Open pittask folder in terminal and type following command:
----------------------------------
|             psiturk            |
----------------------------------
Then:
----------------------------------
|             server on          |
----------------------------------
After these steps you can open following link in the browser: http://localhost:22362

---------------------------------
| Was Performed test input fidelity. Conditions were 1000 mouse clicks and 1000 keyboard
| key press was made with the testing framework Puppeteer. A single click or key press event 
| recorded as two actions "key press" and "key release".
| The sum was 1000 mouse button clicks + 1000
| mouse button releases + 1000 keyboard presses + 1000 keyboard releases =
| 4000 total events. All (4000/4000) were recorded correctly.

22/10/2020 was performed on manual tests with the next operating systems (OS) and browsers. 
Each test in each browser was completely tested from the beginning of the experiment to the end. 

| (OS) Windows 10
    Firefox 79.0
    Opera 71.0.3770.284
    Chrome 86.0.4240.75

                                    Events activity
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
complete.csv records all keyboard and mouse activity in addition to all GUI display. 
These events are recorded in a stereotyped method, that is, an event is recorded in 
the same way whether it occurs in transfer or deval_test. All possible events are 
listed in event_template.csv.

| This is a rule for Version Control. Current version information can be found on Github, at
| https://github.com/Serge-/pittask/releases
|
| Updates Numbers meaning:
| 2.0.0 – MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
|   MAJOR - Total code reconstruction for example when the framework for the application 
|   was upgraded significantly or the framework was changed to any different. 
|   MINOR - New stages, stages removal, stages reordering.
|   PATCH - Bug fixing.
