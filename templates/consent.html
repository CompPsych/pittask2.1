					<h4>
						Participant Selection and Purpose of Study
					</h4>
					<p>
						You are invited to participate in a study of examining reward processing and decision-making in
						typical
						healthy
						adults. We hope to learn how people learn about reward, and how this can influence their future
						behaviour. You
						were selected as a possible participant in this study because you are a user of Mechanical Turk.
					</p>
					<h4>
						Description of Study and Risks
					</h4>
					<p>
						If you decide to participate, you may be asked to complete several questionnaires and
						computer-based tasks
						that
						examine how you process and react to decision-making situations. The computer tasks ask you to
						make keyboard
						responses. This should take around 60 to 90 minutes.
					</p>
					<p>
						No risks are reasonably expected as a result of your participation in this study.
					</p>
					<p>
						We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from this study.
					</p>
					<h4>
						Confidentiality and Disclosure of Information
					</h4>
					<p>
						Any information that is obtained in connection with this study and that can be identified with
						you will remain
						confidential and will be disclosed only with your permission or except as required by law. If
						you give us your
						permission by signing this document, we plan to discuss/publish the results in student theses,
						journal
						publications or scientific meetings. In any publication, information will be provided in such a
						way that you
						cannot be identified.
					</p>
					<h4>
						Recompense to participants
					</h4>
					<p>
						You will be reimbursed through Amazon Mechanical Turk for your time and participation in this
						study. You will
						receive the amount advertised in the HIT via Amazon Mechanical Turk within 14 days of completing
						the HIT.
					</p>
					<h4>
						Your consent
					</h4>
					<p>
						Your decision whether or not to participate will not prejudice your future relations with The
						University of
						New
						South Wales. Submitting your completed questionnaire and/or completing this anonymous online
						task is an
						indication
						of your consent to participate in the study. You can withdraw your responses any time before you
						have
						submitted
						the questionnaire/finished the task. Once you have submitted it, your responses cannot be
						withdrawn because
						they
						are anonymous and therefore we will not be able to tell which one is yours.
					</p>
					<h4>
						Inquiries
					</h4>
					<p>
						If you have any questions or concerns following your participation the UNSW Computational
						Psychiatry Team
						(human.behaviour@unsw.edu.au, +61 2 9385 1824) will be happy to address them. Complaints may be
						directed to
						UNSWâ€™s
						Research Ethics & Compliance Support, telephone +61 2 9385-4235 or +61 2 9385-4958, email
						humanethics@unsw.edu.au
